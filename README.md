# Mine_Sweeper

- Our project's name is the Mine Sweeper Game
- When the game starts, the user is asked how many matrixes she wants.
- After the matrix is created according to the values entered by the user, mines are placed at 1 in 4 of the matrix size.
- Then,The player  enters the spot where he thinks there are no mines.
- If there is mine, the game is over, if there are no mines, the number of mines around is written down.
- If the player reaches the end without opening mines, he wins the game.
- The project player is warned to create at least 2x2 of matrix  
- If the values entered by the player are outside the matrix, they are asked to enter values again.
- Let's start to play the game
